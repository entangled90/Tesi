\section{Superconformal index}
The superconformal index is a quantity that can be calculated in superconformal field theories that counts the number of BPS states with a scale dimension that saturates a unitarity bound.\\
For $\mN=4$ field theories it was first introduced in \cite{Kinney:2005ej}
and it was later modified by Romelsberger for $\mN=1$ field theories in \cite{Romelsberger:2005eg}.\\
The superconformal index can be introduced as a generalization of the Witten index, which is defined as 
\begin{equation}
I = \Tr{ \left[   (-1)^F e^{-\beta E}\right]}
\end{equation}
where $F$ is the fermion number and $E$ the energy of the state.\\
The exponential term in the energy can be seen as a regulator, otherwise the counting would not be well defined.
However, the energy $E$ can be substituted with any operator with positive eigenvalues that commutes with the supercharges. 
There can be added other operators that commute with the supercharges in order to resolve the degeneracies.
\\
We are interested in four dimensional superconformal field theories which are naturally quantized in radial quantization on $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}$. 
As a result, the isometry group is now $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times \mathbb{R}$ and the eight supercharges split into doublets of $SU(2)_L$ for $Q_{\alpha}$ and of $SU(2)_R$ for $S_{\alpha}$.\\
We can pick one of the supercharges, e.g. $Q_1$, and from the superconformal algebra we have the relation
\begin{equation}
 \{Q_1, Q_1^{\dagger} \} = H - \frac{3}{2} R - 2 J_1 = \Delta
 \end{equation} 
 where $H$ is the Hamiltonian in radial quantization, $R$ is the R-charge generator and $J_1$ is one of the generators of $SU(2)_L$. 
 However, in a free theory $\Delta$ has an infinite number of ground states. 
 For this reason the operator used as a regulator is \cite{Romelsberger:2005eg}
 \begin{equation}
 	\Xi = H - \frac{1}{2} R \geq \frac{2}{3} H 
 \end{equation}
As we said before, we can add other terms in order to differentiate the various states.
Such terms are given by the Cartan generators $J_1, J_2$ of the $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ isometry of the three-sphere and by the generators $e_a$ of the internal symmetry group.\\
The superconformal index on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{S}^1$ is then defined as \cite{Romelsberger:2007ec}
\begin{align}
 i( x, h_a) =&
%  \Tr  \left[  (-1)^F e^{ - \mu \Xi } p^{J_1 + J_2 - \frac{R}{2}} q^{J_1 - J_2 - \frac{R}{2} } \prod_a u_a^{e_a}    \right]
\Tr \left[ (-1)^F  e^{ - \mu \Xi} x^{2 J_2} \prod_a h_a^{e_a} \right] \\= &
\Tr \left[ (-1)^F  t^{\Delta} t^{ 2 J_1 - R} x^{2 J_2} \prod_i h_a^{e_a} \right] 
 \end{align} 
 where we defined $t = e^{- \mu}$.
WIth a change of variables, the superconformal index can be written as 
\begin{equation}
 i( p, q, h_a) =
 \Tr  \left[  (-1)^F e^{ - \mu \Xi } p^{J_1 + J_2 - \frac{R}{2}} q^{J_1 - J_2 - \frac{R}{2} } \prod_a u_a^{e_a}    \right]
\end{equation}
where $p,q$ are defined by
\begin{equation}
p = t x \quad q = t x^{-1}
\end{equation}
The values of $p,q$ must satisfy the following conditions for convergence and reality of the index
\begin{equation}
\hbox{Im} (pq) =0 \qquad |p/q| =  1 \qquad | pq| < 1
\label{eqn:reality_convergence_condition_index}
\end{equation}
The superconformal index receives contribution only from states with $\Delta=0$, since $J_1 \pm J_2 - \frac{R}{2}$ and the internal generators commute with $\Delta$.
%For $p=q$ the index on the squashed three-sphere reduces to the index on a round three-sphere.
%The index is invariant under continuous deformation of the theory that preserve the operators appearing in the formula.
%It may seems a trivial fact, but the index is invariant under some non-conformal deformation.
%As a result, it may be computed in a weakly coupled UV theory that flows to a non trivial conformal fixed point, such as the theories appearing in electric magnetic dualities \cite{Romelsberger:2007ec}. \\
The superconformal index can be calculated in two steps.
First, we need to obtain the index on \emph{single particle states}.\\
The index for chiral multiples $\Phi_i$ with R-charge $r_i$, with flavour symmetry group $F_i$ and gauge group $G_i$ reads \cite{Dolan:2008qi}
\begin{equation}
i_{\Phi}(t,x,h,g) = \sum_{i} \frac{ t^{r_i} \chi_{F_i}(h) \, \chi_{G_i}(g) - t^{2-r_i} \chi_{\bar{F}_i}(h) \chi_{\bar{G}_i}(g)}{ (1-tx) (1- t x^{-1})}
\end{equation}
where $h$ and $g$ are the chemical potential for the global and gauge symmetry group respectively. $\chi_{F_i}(h)$ and $\chi_{G_i}(g)$ are the characters of the representation of $\Phi_i$.\\
The index for a vector superfield in the adjoint representation of a gauge group $G$ is given by \cite{Dolan:2008qi}
\begin{equation}
i_{V} (t,x,g) = \frac{2 t^2 - t(x + x^{-1})}{(1-tx) (1 - tx^{-1})} \chi_{adj}(g)
\end{equation}
The index on the single particle states for the complete theory is given by the sum of indices for every field. 
Then, the superconformal index can be calculated by taking the Plethystic exponential \cite{Feng:2007ur} of the full single particle index
\begin{equation}
  I(t,x,h) = \int_{G} \hbox{d} \mu(g)\,  \exp{ \left(  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}i(t^n,x^n,h^n,g^n) \right)}
  \end{equation}  
where $\hbox{d} \mu(g)$ is a $G$ invariant measure.\\
The definition of the superconformal index can be extended to the manifold $\mathbb{S}_b^3 \times \mathbb{S}^1$, where $\mathbb{S}_b^3$ is the squashed three-sphere whose isometry group is only $U(1)_L \times U(1)_R$ \cite{Hama:2011ea}.
The squashed sphere is defined by considering the metric 
\begin{align}
 d s^2 =& a^2 ( d x_0^2 + d x_1^2 ) + b^2 ( d x_2^2 + d x_3^2) \\
 & \; \hbox{with} \qquad  x_0^2 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 = 1
\end{align}
With the change of coordinates 
\begin{align}
x_0  & =  \cos \theta \cos \phi \\
x_1  & = \cos \theta \sin \phi \\
x_2  & = \sin \theta \cos \chi \\
x_3  & = \sin \theta \sin \chi 
\end{align}
we obtain the metric of the squashed sphere
\begin{align}
 d s^2 = f(\theta)^2 d \theta^2 + a^2 \cos^2 \theta d \phi ^2 + b^2 \sin^2 \theta d \chi^2 \\
\hbox{with} \quad f( \theta) = \sqrt{ a^2 \sin^2 \theta + b^2 \cos^2 \theta}
\end{align}
The index on the squashed sphere $\mathbb{S}_b^3 \times \mathbb{S}^1$ should coincide with the index on the round sphere $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{S}^1$ since they have the same topology and the indices receive contributions from the same BPS states.
An explicit calculation \cite{Agarwal:2012hs} shows that this is indeed true. \\
The indices match up to a rescaling of the fugacities $(p,q) \, \rightarrow \, (p^{\frac{1}{a}}, q^{\frac{1}{b}})$ which does not modify the physical content of the index since they are arbitrary parameters and they still satisfy the conditions \eqref{eqn:reality_convergence_condition_index}.\\

An exact calculation of the index can be performed using the following mathematical identities involving the elliptic gamma function $\Gamma_e$.
The index of a chiral field in general can be written as
\begin{equation}
i_{\Phi} (p,q,y) = \frac{y - pq/y}{(1-p)(1-q)} \qquad \hbox{with} \quad p=tx \; q=t x^{-1} \; y = t^R z 
\end{equation}
where $z$ is the fugacity associated to gauge and/or global symmetries.
It can be written as an elliptic gamma function through
\begin{align}
 \exp \left(  
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n} \, i_S(p^n,q^n,y^n) \right)=
& \prod_{j,k \geq 0} \frac{1 - y^{-1}p^{j+1}q^{k+1}}{1 - y p^j q^k}
\overset{def}{=} 
\Gamma_e ( y; p, q) 
\\
& \; \hbox{where} \quad i_S(p,q,y) = \frac{y - pq/y}{(1-p)(1-q)} \quad
\end{align}
In the same variables we can write the \emph{single particle index} of a vector multiplet into
\begin{equation}
i_V(p,q) = - \left( \frac{p}{1-p} + \frac{q}{1-q} \right)
\end{equation}
and use the following identities, where $z$ is the chemical potential associated to the gauge group
\begin{align}
\exp \left(  
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}\, i_V(p^n,q^n) ( z^n + z^{-n}) \right) & = \frac{1}{(1-z)(1-z^{-1}) \Gamma_e(z;p,q) \Gamma_e(z^{-1};p,q)}
\\
\exp \left(
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n} \, i_V(p^n,q^n) \right) & = (p;p) (q;q)
\end{align}
and the \emph{Q-Pochhammer symbol} is defined as
\begin{equation}
(x;p) = \prod_{j \geq 0} ( 1- x p^j)
\end{equation}
Using these identities we can reduce the calculation of the superconformal index to a integral over the gauge group of products of elliptic Gamma functions.\\
We will provide a more detailed calculation for the electric and magnetic theories of Kutasov-Schwimmer duality in the next chapter.
\\
The equality of the superconformal index for pairs of dual theories can be demonstrated using integral identities of elliptic Gamma functions that were first demonstrated by Rains in \cite{rains309252transformations}.
We will use this fact as a starting point in our discussion on the dimensional reduction of electric magnetic dualities.
In fact, shrinking the radius of $\mathbb{S}^1 $ to zero the superconformal index reduces to the partition function of the three dimensional theory on $\mathbb{S}_b^3$ obtained by dimensional reduction, i.e. with an $\eta$ superpotential.\\
