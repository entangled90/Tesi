I want thank my supervisors for the efforts they put in this work.\\
In particular, I want to express my gratitude to Silvia Penati, who gave me the possibility to choose topic I was passionate about even though I was not sure about my scientific interests at the beginning. 
I thank her for the constant support she provided.

I can't express how grateful I am towards Antonio Amariti, who leaded me in this journey and who has been always present for a Skype call when I needed help.
I will always admire your deep passion for physics and the constancy you put in your work.  I can not thank you enough.
