	***Supersimmetria:
		~ + simmetria = + strumenti per studiare teorie
		~Non renormalization theorems (perturbative)
		~ milder divergence 
		~exact results (e.g. superpotential, witten index , exact beta function )
		~Holomorphicity, couplings as background fields (important is smoothness of weak coupling limits, e.g. classic limit g in 0 well defined.
		Use of wilsonian action: no IR divergences)
		~moduli spaces
		--Superconformal group-- more relations, r charge, dimensions ecc
		~brane constructions?
		~Superconformal index
		~Localizations

\section{Introduction}
Supersymmetric quantum field theories enjoy an enlarged group of  symmetries compared to other field theories. 
Since the symmetry group is a non trivial combination of internal and spacetime symmetries, they have many unexpected feature and new techniques were found to study them.

Many of the new tools found are available only for supersymmetric theories, making them the theater for exciting discoveries in physics.
