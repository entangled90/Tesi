\section{Introduction}
In the previous chapter we introduced few examples of electric-magnetic dualities in four and three spacetime dimensions.
It is natural to wonder if it is possible to dimensionally reduce a four dimensional duality to a three dimensional one.\\
Three dimensional field theories feature many differences with respect to their four dimensional analogs.
In four dimension some classical symmetries are forbidden at the quantum level because of anomalies and other symmetries are not present at all such as the 3D topological symmetry.\\
Moreover, in three dimension the classical moduli space of vacua is qualitatively different to the four dimensional one because of the presence of the Coulomb branch.\\
The dynamics of strongly coupled field theories is even more different since in four dimension we have confinement for non-Abelian gauge theories where in three dimensions also abelian gauge theories exihibit confinement.\\
