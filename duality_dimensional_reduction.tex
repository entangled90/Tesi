\chapter{Reduction of 4D dualities to 3D}

%OUTLINE
% 


In the previous chapter we introduced few examples of electric-magnetic dualities in four and three spacetime dimensions.
It is natural to wonder what is the relation between them since they show some similiraties but at the same time the dynamics of field theories in three and four dimensions is different.\\
For example, in three dimensions there are no anomalies and the moduli space features the Coulomb branch. 
Moreover, in three dimensions the axial symmetry is not broken by anomalies and we have a topological symmetry, enforced by a Bianchi identity.\\
The presence of scalars in the vector multiplets allows real mass terms for fields charged under global symmetries, whereas in four dimensions we could only generate holomorphic mass terms.\\
Despite these differences we will be able to dimensionally reduce four dimensional dualities to three dimensional dualities and in some cases we will find dualities that weren't known before as stand-alone three dimensional dualities.\\
